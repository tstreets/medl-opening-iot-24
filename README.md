## Project 1: Circuit City

### Description

Circuit City will be a micro-city that uses IoT technology for traffic monitoring and control. The traffic system will use a combination of LDRs and web app interactions to control the LED traffic lights.

The circuit system will be ran through an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi connected to breadboard under the city. The breadboard will have multiple traffic light LEDs and LDRs connected.

Each traffic light LED has one ground connection and 3 power connects, 1 for each light: red, yellow, green. The traffic lights will be setup to run on a specific schedule. This schedule can be interrupted by one of two things: traffic build up or user control.

Traffic build up will be based on the LDRs. If a consistent blockage of light is detected on one of the streets and not the other then it will signal the web server of the blockage.

User control will be based on any user interactions through the web app that monitors the traffic. When users click to change traffic lights, a signal will be sent to the web server.

### Circuit System

**Components**

- Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
- \_ Breadboard(s)
- 9 traffic LEDs
- 9 LDRs

**Traffic Light Setup**

I will be using 1 traffic light LED and 1 LDR per traffic light setup.
